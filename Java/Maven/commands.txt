Archetype - type of maven repo and management we want to create, we can select from a list based on our requirement.


Maven is based on plugin assembly, maven compiler is also a plugin!

Many stages of MavenÂ 

mvn archetype:generate // specify archetype, groupId, artifactId
mvn compile
mvn install
mvn package
mvn deploy // push to some external maven repo

mvn dependency:resolve
