                    An article (with the linguistic glossing abbreviation art) is a word that is used with a noun (as a
                    standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some
                    languages extending to volume or numerical scope.

                    The articles in English grammar are the and a/an, and in certain contexts some. "An" and "a" are
                    modern forms of the Old English "an", which in Anglian dialects was the number "one" (compare "on"
                    in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the number "owan". Both "on" (respelled "one"
                    by the Norman language) and "an" survived into Modern English, with "one" used as the number and
                    "an" ("a", before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an indefinite article.

                    In many languages, articles are a special part of speech which cannot be easily
                    combined[clarification needed] with other parts of speech. In English grammar, articles are
                    frequently considered part of a broader category called determiners, which contains articles,
                    demonstratives (such as "this" and "that"), possessive determiners (such as "my" and "his"), and
                    quantifiers (such as "all" and "few").[1] Articles and other determiners are also sometimes counted
                    as a type of adjective, since they describe the words that they precede.[2]

                    In languages that employ articles, every common noun, with some exceptions, is expressed with a
                    certain definiteness, definite or indefinite, as an attribute (similar to the way many languages
                    express every noun with a certain grammatical number—singular or plural—or a grammatical gender).
                    Articles are among the most common words in many languages; in English, for example, the most
                    frequent word is the.[3]

                    Articles are usually categorized as either definite or indefinite.[4] A few languages with
                    well-developed systems of articles may distinguish additional subtypes. Within each type, languages
                    may have various forms of each article, due to conforming to grammatical attributes such as gender,
                    number, or case. Articles may also be modified as influenced by adjacent sounds or words as in
                    elision (e.g., French "le" becoming "l'" before a vowel), epenthesis (e.g., English "a" becoming
                    "an" before a vowel), or contraction (e.g. Irish "i + na" becoming "sna").
